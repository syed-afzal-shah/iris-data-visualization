This project presents a step-by-step exploration and visualization of the classic Iris flower dataset using Python libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas. It demonstrates how to analyze the dataset, draw visual insights using various plots, and visually evaluate where a new flower observation may fall based on its features.

Project Structure:
Cell #	Description
1	Import required libraries
2	Load the Iris dataset
3	Display first few rows
4	Dataset summary and data types
5	Basic statistical insights using describe()
6	Count of each flower type (species)
7	Histogram plots for all numerical features
8	Boxplots for each feature across species
9	Grouped boxplots comparing all species
10	Added a new flower and predicted its category

Key Visualizations:
Histograms for individual numeric features

Boxplots per feature and species

Combined feature-wise boxplots grouped by species

Scatter plot showing new flower’s relative position

Insights:
Petal length and petal width are key distinguishing features among species.

Setosa is visually distinct from Versicolor and Virginica.

A new flower with Petal Length = 5.1 and Petal Width = 1.8 closely aligns with Virginica when plotted.
